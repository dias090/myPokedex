# Welcome to My Pokemon App

## Task

The goal of this project is to create a Pokedex, a digital encyclopedia of Pokemon, using React JS and Materialize. The Pokedex will have two main pages. The first page will display a list of all Pokemon, and the second page will show detailed information about a single Pokemon.

## Description

To solve this problem, I used the PokeAPI, a RESTful API that provides data about Pokemon, to fetch and display the Pokemon data in the app. I used React JS to build the user interface and manage the state of the app, and Materialize to style the app and make it visually appealing.

## Usage

To use the application, simply run the following command:

```
npm start
```

The app is simple and intuitive to use. On the first page, you will see a list of all Pokemon. You can scroll through the list or use the search bar at the top to find a specific Pokemon. Clicking on a Pokemon will take you to the second page, where you can see more detailed information about that Pokemon, including its stats, abilities, and evolution chain.
