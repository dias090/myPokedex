# Welcome to My Pokemon App

## Task
The goal of this project is to create a Pokedex, a digital encyclopedia of Pokemon, using React JS and Materialize. The Pokedex will have two main pages. The first page will display a list of all Pokemon, and the second page will show detailed information about a single Pokemon.

## Description
To solve this problem, I used the PokeAPI, a RESTful API that provides data about Pokemon, to fetch and display the Pokemon data in the app. I used React JS to build the user interface and manage the state of the app, and Materialize to style the app and make it visually appealing.

## Installation
To install and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:
    
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dias090/My_Pokedex.git
    ```
    
2. Navigate to the project directory using
    ```
    cd My_Pokedex
    ```
    
3. Install the dependencies using 
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    
4. Start the development server using 
    ```
    npm start
    ```
## Usage
The app is simple and intuitive to use. On the first page, you will see a list of all Pokemon. You can scroll through the list or use the search bar at the top to find a specific Pokemon. Clicking on a Pokemon will take you to the second page, where you can see more detailed information about that Pokemon, including its stats, abilities, and evolution chain.
